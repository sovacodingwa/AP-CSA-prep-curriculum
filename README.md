# Sova Coding AP CSA Prep Curriculum

## Overview
This curriculum is designed for absolute beginners in Java programming, gradually introducing AP CSA concepts across 10 lessons.  
It includes **practice problems** and **examples** to reinforce learning.

The lessons cover:  
1. Printing, variables, working with files/classes  
2. Math operators, user input (Scanner), `for` loops  
3. Comparison operators, `if/else`, modulo, nested conditionals  
4. Classes & objects (fields, constructors, methods)  
5. Arrays (indexing, length, traversing) 
6. Methods (parameters, return values, scope)  
7. Searching arrays & counting items  
8. Summing and finding min/max in arrays (using helper methods)  
9. `while` loops, nested loops, 2D arrays, arrays of objects  
10. **Large Problem Set** of 15 problems of varying difficulty covering **all previous lessons**

## How to Use
- **Teacher-led instruction is required.**  
- The teacher will **explain the concepts** using the sample code provided in each lesson.  
- After instruction, students complete **problem sets** for practice.  
- The problems **do not** contain answers: students are expected to attempt solutions themselves.  
- Teachers may give hints but encourage independent problem-solving.  
- For Lesson 10, students are **encouraged to solve independently**, with fewer points awarded if teacher help is used.  

### Using Codespaces
1. Open the repository in **GitHub Codespaces** by clicking the green **Code** button on the repo page and selecting **Codespaces → New codespace**.  
2. When prompted, select **2-core machine** for better performance.  
3. This will launch a ready-to-use online development environment in your browser, with Java pre-installed.  
4. Students can code directly in Codespaces without needing to install anything locally.  

#### Saving Your Work in Codespaces
1. When you make changes, they are saved automatically in the Codespaces environment, but **not yet in GitHub**.  
2. In the left sidebar, click the **Source Control** icon (or press `Ctrl+Shift+G` / `Cmd+Shift+G`).  
3. Write a short description of what you changed in the **message box** (e.g., "Completed Lesson 2 Practice").  
4. Click the **✓ Commit** button.  
5. Click **Sync Changes** (🔄) to upload your work to GitHub so your teacher can see it.  

#### Shutting Down Codespaces
- Always shut down your Codespace after use to save resources:  
  - Go to the **Codespaces** tab on GitHub (under your profile).  
  - Find the running Codespace.  
  - Click the **⋯** menu and select **Stop Codespace**.  

### Sharing with Teachers via Live Share
- Inside Codespaces, open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).  
- Search for **Live Share: Start Collaboration Session**.  
- Copy the generated **Live Share link** and send it to your teacher so they can join your coding session in real-time.

## Structure
- Each lesson has:  
  - **Sample code**
  - **Practice problems**
- Lesson 10 only includes a problem set which has **points per problem** based on difficulty.
